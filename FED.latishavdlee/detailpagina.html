                <h2>STREAMS</h2>
                <p>For the new recorded sets, we searched for the latest techniques available.
                    A few performances are recorded at the Gashouder, others have been recorded at the hometown of the artist and the show has been created completely digitally. This gave our operators the chance to go even further with the Gashouder and create visuals which are not even possible when we have our audience in the house.</p>

                <h2>ZOOM PARTIES</h2>
                <p>One of the best things of festivals is the fact that you are meeting so many new people from all over the world. This year, we cannot travel to meet each other, but you can meet each other digitally in our zoom rooms!</p>

                <h2>AR + 8D EXPERIENCE</h2>
                <p>We know you guys are always keen on our stages designs. This year, we made the W stage as an Artificial Reality object, so you can place it in your home. Reinier Zonneveld made a special 8 minute set in 8D sound, to give you a unique experience. Don't forget to listen with your earplugs or headphones!</p>

                <h2>MAKE A DONATION TO THE NETHERLANDS RED CROSS</h2>
                <p>Catching up with friends and enjoying parties and events are not possible in the current Corona situation and we all want to let you know: hang in there and never stop dancing, together we can make this trough!
                    We want to make our contribution to the less privileged people who became a victim of this Corona crisis. That’s why we made donation packages, of which 100% of the profit goes to two special projects of the Netherlands Red Cross. To thank you for donating, we added some Awakenings merchandise!</p>
